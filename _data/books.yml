  title: Seam in Action
  author: Dan Allen (JSR-314 EG member)

    Offers an objective and in-depth look at Seam, an integration framework that combines many aspects of Java EE,
    corrects shortcomings in its technologies (JSF, EJB, JPA) and fills in gaps where they interface,
    all while reducing the platform's complexity. This feat is achieved through a consistent use of stateful
    components, annotations, the EL, and XHTML-based templates, giving you maximum distance out of every keystroke.
    As you advance through this book, you'll find your application and understanding of enterprise Java mature
    quickly as you master technologies you thought you'd never have time to learn.


    This book has historical significance because it helped to identify many of the shortcomings in JSF 1.2
    that Seam addressed and explained the reasoning behind several of the features that were introduced into
    JSF 2.0, most notably view parameters, conditional navigation and bookmarkable links.
