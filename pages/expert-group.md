JavaServer Faces (JSF) is governed by an Expert Group (EG) that operates under the Java Community Process (JCP) and 
represents the community of JSF developers and component vendors. The EG works on JSF within the context of a 
Java Specification Request (JSR). The current iteration of the JSF specification is 
[JSR-314](http://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=314), otherwise known as JSF 2.  

The specification defines the API, a standard UI component set and the TCK. It does not include specific 
implementation details. That is a freedom that is granted to anyone wanting to implement the specification.

The mailing list of record for JSF 2.0 Expert Group discussions is jsr-314-open@jcp.org. To join this list in a 
read-only mode, please send an email to list-request@jcp.org with subscribe jsr-314-open as the Subject.  
See the section below on "The Extended EG" for the path to write access to this list.

## <a name="TOC-Extended-EG">Extended EG</a>

An important group to the JSF specification are the members of the implementation teams, component library creators 
and extension writers. While some of the individuals in this group sit on the EG, others are not. Regardless, 
their input is valuable to improving the specification. While they do not have the responsibility of participating 
in the expert group, their unique expertise can help drive design decisions. Therefore, they are considered part of 
the _**extended expert group**_ (EEG) and are granted permission to post to the design list (jsr-314-open).  

This priviledge is not intented to exclude general community members, but rather to keep the discussions on the list 
focused. Any member of the JSF community can post to 
[jsr-314-public](http://wiki.jcp.org/boards/index.php?b=jsr-314-public), which is the open forum for 
discussion of the JSF specification.
